position: 'Co-President'

My major is Computer Science, and I am currently serving as one of URMC's Co-Presidents. I want to merge my passion for coding and product development with my love for the URM community, especially at Cornell. I hope that I can take what Iâ€™ve learned in my CIS courses and use it to inspire others to create community impact. If you at all related to my interests and goals, please reach out to me because I have a dope side project in the works right now!
