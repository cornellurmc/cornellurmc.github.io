I'm a rising senior currently serving as our Opportunities Chair and the URMC POC for the Cracking the Coding Interview Course. I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, and my parents are from Togo. I'm working on a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

I interned twice at Facebook in Seattle as a software engineer, and will continue to work there full-time after graduating. My interests include playing piano, producing music, computer graphics/animation/visual effects, ice-skating, and learning languages.
