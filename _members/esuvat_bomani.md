position: 'Professional Development Chair'

I am a current junior studying Information Science with a minor in Computer Science at Cornell. I am from Tanzania, East Africa and in my free time I like to paint and read books. I currently serve as the Professional development chair for URMC because I believe in our power as an organization to empower URM's in their journeys towards their goals. 

Over the summer, I worked for Uber on the Uber Eats team. 
I like to explore new movies, new places, networking, coding, and watching random, dumb, YouTube videos and movies.
