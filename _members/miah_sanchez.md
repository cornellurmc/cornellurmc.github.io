Hi, my name is Miah Sanchez and i am a freshman in the College of Engineering and i am an intended computer  science major! Some of my goals include becoming a software developer, i love coding and i cannot wait for it to become my career! i am the co-outreach chair on the URMC e-board.  URMC is really important to me because i think a community like this is essential both for professional and personal growth and i hope i can one day inspire people the way URMC members have inspired me.  Outside of computer science i love music, i even collect vinyl records and i looooove dogs!! ðŸ™‚
