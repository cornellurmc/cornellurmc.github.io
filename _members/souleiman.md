Souleiman is a sophomore studying Computer Science. He considers himself fortunate to be at the nexus of three cultures; Hispanic, through his Colombian mother, Arab, through his Moroccan father, and Muslim culture through his religion, all three combining to inform his personal identity. Souleiman currently serves as a co-mentorship director on the URMC Executive board. Souleiman highly values the mentorship process as a vital way to encourage students to pursue CIS majors and optimize their experiences. In his free time, Souleiman enjoys reading, soccer, and tennis, as well as hackathons and developing side projects.
