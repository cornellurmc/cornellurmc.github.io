Angie is a second semester sophomore studying Information Science. She is originally from Honduras, but was raised in the Bronx.

Previously, Angie served as a Freshman/Sophomore representative, and will be the Events Chair this coming semester. She hopes that URMC can continue to be a resource and provide a safe space for under-represented groups in the CIS department. Outside of URMC, her involvement includes being Vice President of the Multicultural Greek and Fraternal Council and President of Sigma Lambda Upsilon Sorority, Inc. In her free time, she enjoys playing softball, listening to music and binge watching Adult Swim shows.
