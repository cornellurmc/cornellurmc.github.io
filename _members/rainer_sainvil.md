My name is Rainer Sainvil, a sophomore in the College of Engineering. I am a Computer Science major and Dyson Business minor from Brooklyn, NY. My position with URMC is Co-Outreach Chair, where I am especially concerned with bringing in and providing those students outside the community a space where they can feel more comfortable and confident pursuing their goals in tech. This semester I am an instructor for Cracking the Coding Interview and will be running the Under the Hood Series. Outside of school, I like to play basketball, IRL and 2K, and listen to music.
