I am currently the Associate Corporate Director for URMC since last fall semester. I am a junior majoring in Information Science and minoring in both Business and Environmental Science. Some of my interests include reading, working out, and trying out new foods. In the future, I hope to merge my interest in technology and business into a career where I am able to give back to others.
