My name is Maxine and I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science hoping to land a career in software development! I'm the 5th of 6 children to Nigerian Igbo parents and currently live in New Jersey. Some of my hobbies include singing, playing piano and playing violin. I hope to be able to leave an impact on other URMs by motivating them to achieve their goals while ignoring societal barriers.
