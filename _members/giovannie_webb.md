My major is Computer Science, and I am excited to be a part of the URMC community. What originally started out as a seemingly fun hobby has become a passion. That passion is coding, and I see myself as a software engineer in the future, and hopefully an executive of my very own software-based company. A few of my other interests include playing soccer (although I am officially retired) and playing video games until I can't anymore. Supporting underrepresented minorities is a top priority of mine, and what better way to do so than through computing, something that I love? I look forward to working with URMC to accomplish this goal and many more goals to come.
