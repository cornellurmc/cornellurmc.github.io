Raheel is an Ahmadi Muslim of Ghanaian descent from the Bronx. He majors in Computer Science and plan to minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship. 

Through URMC, Raheel has found purpose. He knew he wanted to serve the members of his community but he didn't know how and feared his time was running out. Raheel believes URMs have unlimited potential but can often lack the confidence necessary to reach their full potential. Raheel believes it is his responsibility to make sure that he uplifts himself and his fellow URMs and leverages all of the knowledge at his disposal to help actualize their goals and dreams.

He loves photography, coding, learning, (trying to love) reading, and stepping out of his comfort zone.

He values self-reflection, self-accountability, self-discipline, and self-control.
